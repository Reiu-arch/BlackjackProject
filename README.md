## Description 
This project is still a work in progress, the intended purpose of this project was to be able to play a single round of blackjack. For the most part the program does work to an extent. The program runs and lets you choose to either hit or stand, at the current moment going over 21 does not break one out of the loop and display a bust nor when the dealer busts either. Still needs some work when it comes to compairing the two numbers as well as when displaying the correct outcome of the game. 
## Usage 
For the moment the program only works half of the time to get an accurate reading of who the winner is.

## Lessons Learned
From what I have learned today is that trying to make a blackjack table for a single round is pretty hard to create. I may have strayed away somewhere in my coding but havent been able to find out where the fault lies. Ive tried to troubleshoot my program for a long time with no avail, unfortunatly I have figured out that creating a mistake while having the program still running and throwing no codes is far harder to fix than when an exception is thrown. I do need a fair bit more practice when it comes to java.
